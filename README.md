# Global actions curb PFOS, yet emerging PFAS are on the rise

**Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating the effectiveness of policy interventions globally and across specific regions. Using the Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) method, it quantifies the impact of policy implementation on PFOS concentrations in surface water.

**Contents**

This repository contains all the original code and source data involved in this study. It includes:

- A set of code **'ITSA_Global'** and data **'global_monthly_cell_PFOS'** for evaluating the effects of global intervention policies
- Code **'ITSA_Region'** for assessing regional policy effects

The three additional CSV files in **'Data'** contain data for China, the United States, and the European Union respectively, each with different policy intervention points (see comments in **'ITSA_Region'** for details).

All work can be run with just a working version of Python. Required packages are mentioned in the code. The output includes both quantitative results of intervention effects and visualization results.
